# Linear-Regression-with-scraping

The aim of this project was to scrape data from any site and perform Linear Regression. I picked IMDB and scraped data using BeautifulSoup and Selenium. 

I was trying to predict IMDB ratings from all the data that I scraped. I ran Ordinary Least Squares as well as Lasso and Ridge Regression. Ridge regression had a better performance after tuning the hyperparameters.
